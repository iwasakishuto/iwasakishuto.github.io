MNIST is also called <b>"Hello World" dataset of computer vison</b>, so I chose this as my first `TensorFlow.js` app.

## Training
The way of training is following the [Keras Documentation](https://keras.io/examples/mnist_cnn/), and you can look the entire code at [Training.ipynb](https://github.com/iwasakishuto/iwasakishuto.github.io/blob/master/js/TensorFlowJs/MNIST/Training.ipynb).

The model architecture is as below;
