| 1     | Introduction                     | what the "Pattern Recognition" is about. It is "realizing human cognitive activities by engineering method."                                                                                                                                              |
| 2     | Probability Distributions        | Exploration of some particular examples of probability distributions and their properties.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 3     | Linear Models for Regression     | Start with the simplest form of linear regression models.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 4     | Linear Models for Classification | Introduction abou simplest classification methods. "Classigication" and "Regression" are 2 big genres.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 5     | Neural Networks                  | How to fit models to the data in Neural Network. We use "backpropagation", and this method reduces computational complexity.                                                                                                                              |
| 6     | Kernel Methon                    | Kernel Methon realize "infinite dimensional Neural Network", because computational complexity only depends on data sizes.                                                                                                                                 |
| 7     | Sparse Kernel Machines           | Based on the concept of "maximizing margin", think directly of discrimination surface.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 8     | Graphical Models                 | Graphical model is a representation of the probability distribution using a "directed graph" or an "undirected graph". In this case, the structure of the conditional independence of the probability distribution can be expressed as a graph structure. |
| 9     | Mixture Models and EM            | If the probability distribution is complex, we can't calcurate some parameters directly, so we "Maximize the Expectation" repeatedly, to calcurate it.                                                                                                    |
| 10    | Approximate Inference            | It is often the case that we can't calcurate analytically, so we have to use approximate inference as possible as accurate.                                                                                                                               |
| 11    | Sampling Methods                 | It is one of the approximate way for calcurating probability distribution. If we have enough time and machine power we can approximate with arbitrary precision.                                                                                          |
| 12    | Continuous Latent Variables      | This chapter shows Principal Component Analysis. We can know some clasters of data by enginerring method.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 13    | Sequential Data                  | We learn Markov model, and HMM. It is useful for DNA sequention models and other models. I think this chapter is little bit different from other chapters.                                                                                                |
| 14    | Combining Models                 | We combine some models by vote or mean, so that we can predict data more accuratly.                                                                                                                                                                       |

| ext.3 | Reinforcement Learning           | Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.                                                                 |
| ext.4 | Natural language processing      | Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science concerned with how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.                                                                                |
| ext.5 | Automatic Speech Recognition     | Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is the inter-disciplinary sub-field of computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that enables the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers.                  |
| ext.6 | Semantic Segmentation            | Semantic Segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments (sets of pixels, also known as super-pixels).                                                                                                                 |
